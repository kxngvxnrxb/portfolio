                I’m a frontend developer specializing in Angular, APIs, and data-driven applications.
                My background includes backend development, IT systems, and databases,
                which helps me build applications that are both visually clean and technically reliable.
            </p>

            <p class="muted">
                I also have experience in graphic design and basic data analytics,
                working with tools like Photoshop, Canva, Excel, and Power BI.
                This helps me approach interfaces with both usability and data clarity in mind.
            </p>

            <p class="muted">
                Recently, I’ve been expanding into workflow automation using tools like n8n
                and GoHighLevel to streamline processes such as lead intake, email workflows, and scheduling.
